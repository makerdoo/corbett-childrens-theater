<h3>Special Announcement from Our Artistic Director</h3>
<br>
			<p>Have you ever had something you needed to do… but you just kept avoiding the task?</p>

			<p>That's how I feel about this letter. I just don’t want to admit that I have to write it. Putting 

			these words on paper is painful, frustrating, and frightening.</p>

			<p>But here they are: <span style="font-weight:900;">This coming fall may well cue the final curtain for Corbett Children’s Theater.</span></p>

			<p>We've had a good run:  From a Corbett back yard in 1998, to a long and close 

			relationship with the Corbett School District until recent growth put an end to their ability 

			to offer us space, CCT has been able to work with youth from eastern Multnomah 

			county as well as those from as far away as Beaverton and Vancouver, Washington. 

			Unfortunately, the loss of space at the school district has created a severe financial 

			crisis for Corbett Children's Theater.<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> We have less than a year left at current expense levels.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight:900;">What we need are people like you who are willing to step forward and help us fill 

			the gap.</span> You see, Corbett Children’s Theater is more than a stage. It is more than 

			productions and performances.<span style="font-weight:900;"> CCT is where students are challenged, inspired, 

			broadened and encouraged because youth who know how to work together to 

			meet deadlines, think critically and creatively to solve problems are worth the 

			investment in our community's future. </span>
			</p>

			<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">We don't need a fancy space.</span>  We just need an inexpensive space. We don't even need 

			a stage, just a large, empty space somewhere in East Multnomah County. As long as it 

			has bathrooms, heat, power, and parking we can function.
			</p>
			<p>
			Might you be willing to step forward to ensure that the curtain does not fall on CCT and 

			the youth of Eastern Multnomah County?  A gift of $20, $200, $2000, or more would 

			help us keep the doors open. CCT is a 501(c)(3)  non-profit so all donations are tax 

			deductible.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p style="float:left;">Thank you for your consideration,</p>
			<br>
			<p style="float:left;display:block;">Angel Williams, Artistic Director</p>
